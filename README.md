# RevvyDemoKit

Generated by STM32CubeMX 4.27.0 with STM32CubeF4 Firmware Package V1.21.0 / 23-February-2018

2018-11-03:
- 6x 20kHz PWM
- 6x 50Hz PWM
- WS2812 driver with DMA for 4 LEDs
- 6 ADC with DMA
- EXTI for 6 motor encoders using direction bit
- EXTI for 4 sensors
- GPIO inputs and outputs

2018-11-04:
- Cleanup of unused source files
- Cleanup of naming conventions in CubeMX project
- 4x ultrasonic distance sensors are working with 10us resolution based on TIM10
- 6x encoder signals are processed to distance [m], angle [deg] and velocity [m/s]
- Accelerometer and compass is working on I2C1 interface
- Roll and pitch angles are calculated from accelerometer
- Buzzer added TIM9_CH2


No patch is needed after code generation!

ToDo:
- Compass is not calibrated yet
- 6 PID controller
- USB Host?
